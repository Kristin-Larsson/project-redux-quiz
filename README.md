# Redux quiz group project

This project was made during the Technigo bootcamp. We used Redux for the first time to build a multiple-choice quiz game. We've been working in a group of five, using mob-programming in pairs and git-branches.


## The problem

We started with planning the project in Figma deciding type of quiz, design and what kind of components we first thought was needed. Since we've different time schedules we also mapped out who worked when. The plan was to at least build the base in group, but due to schedule we needed to split up.

We used the techniques that's associated with Redux and also got more practice in React styled components.

We reached several stretch goals, but if we had more time we would have worked more on the styling.
